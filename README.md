# note-taker-express-js
A web application for simple note taking

## Description
The task was to develop the back end for a web application that allows a user to write and save notes. The usage of express.js was necessary in order to incorporate HTTP requests using methods like GET, POST, and DELETE. The server side needed defined routes for each function of the application so that the front end can communicate with the back end. The note taking app can save a user's note and store it remotely on the server side. You can also view existing notes, make modifications to it, and even delete notes. The front end was already developed and provided to me. All I did was develop the routes using express.js for this to allk work.

## Installation
No need to install anything. Click on the Heroku link to test the web app in the deployed links section.

## Usage
Type in a title for the note and the content for the note. Save the note by clicking on the floppy disk icon on the top right corner of the screen. The notes will then be displayed on the left hand side.
